        <h3>Biography:</h3>
        <P>
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> graduate from <strong>American International University–Bangladesh
                (AIUB)</strong> with a focus on <strong>Machine Learning</strong>.
            Built practical <strong>Machine Learning models</strong> and <strong>full-stack projects</strong>, with
            hands-on
            experience in <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>,
            <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I enjoy turning messy data and
            vague ideas into clear, working solutions—writing clean code, documenting carefully, and
            iterating fast with feedback. Curious, fast-learning, and eager to contribute as an <strong>ML/Software
                Engineer</strong> on teams that value ownership, collaboration, and real-world impact.
